# Introduction
In this project, I have build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, I have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before I move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch.

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) 

# Instructions
git clone https://github.com/imsaksham-c/UdacityDeepLearningNanodegree.git
cd into the project-bikesharing directory.
Download anaconda or miniconda based on the instructions in the Anaconda lesson. These are also outlined in the repository README.
Create a new conda environment:
conda create --name deep-learning python=3
Enter your new environment:
Mac/Linux: >> source activate deep-learning
Windows: >> activate deep-learning
Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed by doing the following:
conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
Run the following to open up the notebook server:
jupyter notebook
In your browser, open Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb.
enjoy :)
