# Generate TV Scripts

## Introduction
In this project, I have build an algorithm to generate our own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I have used a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network I have build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

# Instructions
1. clone the repo by using -
    git clone https://github.com/imsaksham-c/UdacityDeepLearningNanodegree.git
    cd Project-TV-Script-Generator
    open dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb
    
Happy Coding :)
