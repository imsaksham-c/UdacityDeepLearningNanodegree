# Project Overview

Welcome to the SageMaker deployment project! In this project I have constructed a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I created this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, I have deployed my model and constructed a simple web app which interacts with the deployed model.

Evertything is done on Amazon Sagemaker, from model training to deployment.

## Steps-
1. Clone the repo - git clone https://github.com/imsaksham-c/UdacityDeepLearningNanodegree.git
2. cd Project-DeployingSentimentAnalysisModel
3. Open Sagemaker Project.ipynb
4. Follow the steps mentioned

Happy Coading :)
