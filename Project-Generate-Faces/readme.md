# Face Generation

In this project, I have define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. The goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

The project will be broken down into a series of tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks. At the end of the notebook, we'll be able to visualize the results of your trained Generator to see how it performs; your generated samples should look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.

## Get the Data

I have used the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)[http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html] to train my adversarial networks.

## Steps

1. Clone the repo - git clone https://github.com/imsaksham-c/UdacityDeepLearningNanodegree.git
2. cd Project-Generate-Faces
3. Open dlnd_face_generation.ipynb

Happy Coding :)
